Description:
FC_Rpg is a plugin that completely converts bukkit servers, into Rpg servers. FC_Rpg aims to be the number one RPG plugin that can be easily installed to your server and setup quickly without requiring spout and/or other client mods. By using FC_Rpg, you can bring an RPG experience to your server like no other! Do not let this short description fool you. This plugin is jam packed with more features than you might believe. With 100+ commands, unique features you can find nowhere else like instanced dungeons and old-school stats, and maximum configuration, FC_Rpg is the plugin that you need to take your server to the medieval age.

Please note this plugin is in BETA. There may be bugs and or requirements to delete files. Lots of things have already changed from past versions and I expect a lot more changes. This plugin is expanding rapidly and being developed constantly!

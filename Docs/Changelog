~ FC_Rpg Changelog ~

Version 1.25 v2:

General:
- Removed old Essentials related code.
- Added new /world command. Optimized world code a bit. Updated Setup to emphasize use of new command /world toggleRpg. I am sorry, the help does say you need to set the world to rpg but the ordering of the help was wrong. Very deeply sorry.
- Fixed a few versioning errors with player configs.
- Fixed an issue with spell levels and spell binds being broken. Big pain. :/

Worlds:
- Forcing reupdate of world levelone settings. Apparently I broke the order in 1.24, my bad on that.

Version 1.25:

General:
- Updated timed items section. Put down -1 as an entry for the ids field if you want to disable giving timed items.
- Fixed no commands working unless you use them as console.

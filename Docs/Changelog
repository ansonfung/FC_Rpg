~ FC_Rpg Changelog ~

Version 1.23:

General:
- A few string upgrades.
- Added new customizable timer for amount of milliseconds a person has to wait before they can re-enter a dungeon. 5 minutes by default.
- Updated class view command display a lot.

Commands:
- /rpgHelp made back to /rpg by default. /radmin is still /radmin.
- Help command messaged to players when they pick a class will now with the /rpg setting being changed.

Combat:
- Leveling up now shoots out fireworks. :)
- Bows can have enchantments.

Version 1.22:

General:
- Made timed items capable of being set to empty. Delete the field, set to unreal numbers, doesn't matter! Go nuts.
- /radmin spawn command now automatically puts input for entity in caps.
- Made class colors completely compatible with signs now. Put color codes on classes, do whatever you want with them. ^^. Also makes sign colors non-important, but can be set to anything.
- Bats added to non-hostile mobs list going forward. No overpowered bats anymore :(.

ItemConfig:
- Item config golden item drops set back to 999,999 by default so that you can fight monsters above level 100 without fatal crashes.
- Bows now set to enchantable again. Woops.

Combat:
- Battle display upgraded once more. Whatever deals damage to you will now be displayed. Slashes are now double slashes.
- Default exp scaling of mobs cut by 1/10th.
- Fully removed all bonus percents from mobs. This means that killing mobs stronger or weaker has no penalties. Balance config settings removed for this.
- Bosses for dungeons are now 20% stronger than the lowest level person in the dungeon, rather than being a flat 5 levels above.
- Enchanted swords now break.
- Enchanted swords are given unbreaking to not break as fast. Each level of unbreaking will grant an additional 1% chance to not break. Thus, unbreaking 100 = never break.

Guilds:
- Non-Guild players, or solo players will no longer get negative gold/exp from mobs.
- Guild names now must be within 3-10 characters.
- Optional guild creation cost.
- Leaders leaving guilds will now properly give leadership to the person that joined the guild after them.
- Guild deletions will no longer clear the guild list field, sigh. lol.

Dungeons:
- Added treasure management commands to /de. 
- None of the commands are based on player position in /de. They work on your first and, if needed, second selections using your selection tool (default bedrock).
- Heavy upgrade to the way that spawnbox selection regions are implemented as well as treasure regions.
- Tested dungeon creation via commands, was able to make a dungeon in 2 minutes. :)
- Non-hostile mobs no longer checked in dungeon completion check. Spawn bats or whatever you want now. ^^.
- Dungeon completion delayed by 3 seconds rather than 1 second after you kill the final mob. This gives plugins and Bukkit a chance to process mob deaths better.

SpellConfig:
- New "Heal Self Percent" effect id: 1020 now used for defender heal. Update accordingly if needed.
- Also, heal notifications are now placed AFTER the spell cast notification. This orders chat better.

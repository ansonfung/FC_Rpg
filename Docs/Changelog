~ FC_Rpg Changelog ~

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.32 BETA:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
General:
- Fixed issue with the custom mob damages setting not properly being read from config.
- Updated readme to reflect new front page description.
- Made a few changes to some config data retreiving methods for new FC_Suite_Shared. This update doesn't require you to update FC_Suite_Shared though.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.31 BETA:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
General:
- Fixed issue with balance config setting. For some reason gets set to 0 for people, I don't know why. This will force it to be 4 for next update.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.3 BETA:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
FC_Suite_Shared Requirement: Version 2.55

Configs you will have to update in this version:
- ItemConfig.yml
- SpellConfig.yml
- Enchantments.yml (Brand new, recommended to review and update.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
General:
- I recommend making a full backup of your server for this update. I do not generally adivse something like this, but this version has so much new content that I have not been able to playtest with any live testers, that the chance of bugs are great. I have done my best to test everything but bugs may or may not have slipped in. This risk always exists with my updates, but usually the risk is very small. I have to say that the risk on this update is pretty big, namely due to the custom item enchantments. As such this is going to be classed as a BETA. Once I have confirmed that this version is working well, I'm going to release a release version 1.31. I feel that a 1.31 release version is pretty much garutneed due to the amount of new content.
- Added new nick feature. Comes with generalconfig setting for a prefix on nicks. Can be customized with modify command.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Players:
- Fixed issue where player health wasn't being loaded on player joins.
- Optimized health saving.
- Readded level 1 spell point. Removed spell point given when player is at level cap. Players will be force respec'd to accomodate for this. Sorry >.<. The main issue is that mages need spells to be effective at level 1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Commands:
- Added new /rpg help command to allow players to get some insight into how FC_Rpg works.
- Renamed /world to /realm to prevent conflict with other commands that might use that command (like Essentials). This was implemented quickly. Expect any old things named "world" to be all fixed by 1.31.
- Updated /radmin spawn command to support the spawning of more than one entity. Now you can spawn an army of level 100 spiders! :D

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Items (ItemConfig/TreasureCofig):
- FC_Rpg now uses ItemMeta to create custom enchanted loot. Items may have a tier, prefix, suffix, and plusNumber to denote the abilities of said item.
- ItemConfig settings for sword multipliers are force changed in update. New multipliers remove 1 from old default. This is to help with new enchanted items.
- Heavily optimized item drop function. LIKE OH MY GOD (why didn't I do this before). Also will now auto-detect if no suitable item drops can be found when you kill monster rather than crashing server.
- Can no longer rename items at anvil, to prevent abuse.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Spells:
- Whenever you use the /spell reset command your active spell will be reset.
- Whenever you attempt to use a spell without the proper required item, your active spell will be reset.
- Both changes targetting at stopping message spam willingly and unwillingly.
- Several new effect ids in place that can be added to create custom spells. These were made for the enchantments of items BUT can be definately used in spells.
- Had to overhaul the spell config quite a bit due to the addition of enchantments. Sadly old spell configs will not be compatible with new version. Backup your old configuration file and import settings into the new configuration file if you use custom spells. There are 13 new effect ids, 6 are old effect ids turned into non-buff forms.
- Any spell can now have a duration. If you want a spell to be a one-time cast, then don't give it a duration and it will only cast once. :)
- Fixed tons of spell bugs and added some missing features.
- Due to my huge overhaul of spell stuff, you can now see the name of buffs placed on you as well as the name of the buff when removed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Combat:
- Monster level when hit is now green.
- Since swords technically will not use regular enchanted items anymore, all swords will break. (No more huge unbreaking levels anymore). However there are hardcoded unbreaking limits. Every item helmet has about 10k uses as refrence. Same applies to armor.
- Fixed bug where bows weren't using bonus stat points in damage calculation during attacks. (sneaky fix)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dungeons:
- Hitting dungeon leave sign will now properly teleport players out of dungeons once again.
- Default dungeon location when creating a new dungeon will be at 110, rather than 0. This will stop people dying when accidentally hitting new dungeon signs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Treasure:
- Added a few new settings to control custom enchantment drop rates. Want all legendaries? GO FOR IT.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Balance:
- New settings to scale specific monsters attack, constitution, gold, and experience values under "mob" called "bonus". Check setup for information on how to use.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Signs:
- Added the new fill health sign.
- Entirely new sign format. Now you use [Enter] and [Fill Mana] and [Fill Health] as signs. Setup now tells you how to make signs.
- /radmin wall will now spawn updated signs and will also put down the mana and health signs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Setup/Help:
- Updated setup a bit more. Going to read through and try to fix any other errors. Always a WIP to make sure setup is up to date and everything is correct in it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Compatibility:
- qQuest support being integraded. Working with quaz3l closely on this. He's a fantastic developer and his plugin qQuests is amazing! Right now minimum level requirement added.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Internal:
- Removed some outdated/unused code related to rpgMonsters.
- Removed lots of outdated comments for several classes.
- Performed several small optimizations to battle function in the hopes that it will make it run faster.
- Several optimizations for spells overall due to overhaul.
- Improved sign selection functions due to sign overhaul.

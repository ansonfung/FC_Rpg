~ FC_Rpg Changelog ~

Version 1.23-1.24:

Small Disclaimer: As with all new features, please bear with any bugs. There are quite a few new features, updates, and bug fixes in this update so please make tickets if anything is wrong. This is one of (AND PROBABLY IS) the biggest (yes, you read that right, biggest) updates so far.

General:
- A few string upgrades.
- Added new customizable timer for amount of milliseconds a person has to wait before they can re-enter a dungeon. 5 minutes by default.
- Updated class view command display a lot.
- Fixed issue with first time dungeon configs bugging out. (Nobody experienced this, was a 1.22 bug).
- Perfect birch setting now only applies to rpg worlds.
- New default dungeon tool is a diamond ore.

Commands:
- /rpgHelp made back to /rpg by default. /radmin is still /radmin.
- Help command messaged to players when they pick a class will now with the /rpg setting being changed.

Combat:
- Leveling up now shoots out fireworks. :)
- Bows can have enchantments. (again)
- Added the ability to disable sword knockback.
- Enchantments will not be dropped from mobs if they are disabled. (arrow knockback, I think punch, and sword knockback now included)
- Fixed level from /radmin spawn command now applies to non-dungeon monsters as well.

Enchanting:
- Enchantments are now restricted based on your configured settings (can't get knockback if knockback is disabled, etc.). All fire enchants banned.

Guilds:
- Fixed being unable to open guilds.
- No longer using the guild list setting in guilds config. I am now directly getting the list of guilds from the folder. (Java noob, didn't know I could do this till I researched, :D lol)
- Fixed issue with guilds not properly reassigning leader when a member left.
- Experience is split between guild members that are within 50 blocks of you now, rather than being global.

Worlds:
- Can now set the scale x,y,z setting per world.
- Can also now set a level cap per world in which mobs can't spawn higher than that level. This is a HARD cap, meaning it effects dungeons, level bonuses, everything! Only applies when set higher than 0.
- Both new settings will automatically be updated in world config. Also old scale setting will be removed from general config.

Treasure:
- Added in these brand new LOOTCONFIGS that you can create. Basically, you can define the items to drop from monsters and dungeons. If more instances of custom loot are needed, this will be expanded. See help for more info.

Dungeons:
- Added in the ability to set the level of a dungeon to some static value. This means that monsters that spawn in the dungeon will always be this level.
- Added new dungeon config setting that will allow you to set the loot setting (from treasure config) that will be monster loot.

Balance:
- Added new config setting to change loot drops of all monsters.

Warps:
- Warps have 3 new settings. A class requirement setting. A job level requirement setting. A level minimum before you can enter.

Setup.txt:
- Updated the lettering in the table of contents to match the actual fields. There were off in a lot of cases.
- Added in new settings and explanations on how to use them.
- Made the file look a little bit fancier on headers so they stand out more.

Internal/FC_Suite_Shared:
- Taking greater advantage of a lot of new and old classes I created to increase code reusability.
- Heavy optimizations to the way that information is handled.

Version 1.22:

General:
- Made timed items capable of being set to empty. Delete the field, set to unreal numbers, doesn't matter! Go nuts.
- /radmin spawn command now automatically puts input for entity in caps.
- Made class colors completely compatible with signs now. Put color codes on classes, do whatever you want with them. ^^. Also makes sign colors non-important, but can be set to anything.
- Bats added to non-hostile mobs list going forward. No overpowered bats anymore :(.

ItemConfig:
- Item config golden item drops set back to 999,999 by default so that you can fight monsters above level 100 without fatal crashes.
- Bows now set to enchantable again. Woops.

Combat:
- Battle display upgraded once more. Whatever deals damage to you will now be displayed. Slashes are now double slashes.
- Default exp scaling of mobs cut by 1/10th.
- Fully removed all bonus percents from mobs. This means that killing mobs stronger or weaker has no penalties. Balance config settings removed for this.
- Bosses for dungeons are now 20% stronger than the lowest level person in the dungeon, rather than being a flat 5 levels above.
- Enchanted swords now break.
- Enchanted swords are given unbreaking to not break as fast. Each level of unbreaking will grant an additional 1% chance to not break. Thus, unbreaking 100 = never break.

Guilds:
- Non-Guild players, or solo players will no longer get negative gold/exp from mobs.
- Guild names now must be within 3-10 characters.
- Optional guild creation cost.
- Leaders leaving guilds will now properly give leadership to the person that joined the guild after them.
- Guild deletions will no longer clear the guild list field, sigh. lol.

Dungeons:
- Added treasure management commands to /de. 
- None of the commands are based on player position in /de. They work on your first and, if needed, second selections using your selection tool (default bedrock).
- Heavy upgrade to the way that spawnbox selection regions are implemented as well as treasure regions.
- Tested dungeon creation via commands, was able to make a dungeon in 2 minutes. :)
- Non-hostile mobs no longer checked in dungeon completion check. Spawn bats or whatever you want now. ^^.
- Dungeon completion delayed by 3 seconds rather than 1 second after you kill the final mob. This gives plugins and Bukkit a chance to process mob deaths better.

SpellConfig:
- New "Heal Self Percent" effect id: 1020 now used for defender heal. Update accordingly if needed.
- Also, heal notifications are now placed AFTER the spell cast notification. This orders chat better.

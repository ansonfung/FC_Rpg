~ FC_Rpg, Developer Personal Notes ~

^Todo List^
- Items with lore cost more to repair. <- should be done.
- Test dungeons attempting to pay. <- don't care.
- Spell list, spell info. <- Will add next version.

Not as important todo:
- Double Test that enchanted items don't count as lore "the enchants aren't lore" and people can't rename items as a cheat way of getting super items. Maybe think of better method like checking for the dashed lines in lore. That might be better.
- Test frost strikes not breaking.
- Add in commands to handle some of the new features after they have been tested as completely bug free. "test"
- Customizable mob stats. <- skeleton melee vs. ranged damage customization.

Personal Dev Note From Destro168:

FC_Rpg is the only plugin of it's kind. There are no copycats, no clones, no plugins that 'do what it does' better. There is no competition with FC_Rpg in comparison to other RPG plugins because no other plugin does what FC_Rpg does. FC_Rpg goes far beyond being 'just another rpg plugin' and far beyond being 'just a rpg plugin'.

The reactions that I get when people first use FC_Rpg or when I tell them they can do something they didn't know about are priceless to me. If you are even remotely interested in classical rpg games, then you NEED to try out FC_Rpg! Even if you just want to play with a small group of friends, try it out. Play it solo if you want. 

People always ask me "What does FC_Rpg do?". Every single time I instantly respond,
"Everything"

FC_Suite_Shared Requirement: Version 2.56
-------------------------------------------------------------------
General:
- Updated isAoE realm setting comptability for latest version of mcmmo.
- Fixed issue with nick not being set for players during first run causing issues.
- Did a bit of re-theming for mages /alchemy command to accomodate two new commands.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Enchanting:
- Recoded enchanting so that you now get custom RPG items from it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Commands:
- Updated /radmin wall again. Now scales to fit all warps and classes. No longer can grief.
- Removed debug line of text.
- Dungeon commands now don't require a class to use.
- Added two new commands, /gold, and /forge.
- Forge can be used to repair items.
- Added permissions check to /realm. Apparently it wasn't checking permissions. Who knew! At least nobody noticed this... I think.
- Alchemy command now uses /alchemy transmute rather than smelt.
- Updated the message lib a bit to fix some permission issues.
- Updated the /rpg help and /rpg info into a merged all in one help command. All available in /rpg now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Balance:
- Added balance config settings to manage ranged vs. melee damage multipliers. BETTER LOVE ME iVIP.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Economy:
- The entire economy of FC_Rpg has been moved to gold. Every instance of giving or taking money now works through gold.
- Servers can customize a conversion rate between server currency and gold. This allows server owners to create an extremely isolated and controllable economy within FC_Rpg if desired. Conversely, the FC_Rpg economy can be free and open. If the conversation rate is set to 0 or lower it will disable the setting.

~ FC_Rpg Changelog ~

-------------------------------------------------------------------
* Version 1.34:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
FC_Suite_Shared Requirement: Version 2.57
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Configs you will have to update in this version:
- Classes.yml

-------------------------------------------------------------------
General:
- Fixed instance of double formatting which was causing /class view to break for certain people. Ticket-#60.
- Removed some debug text that may or may not have slipped into beta 1.33.
- Added new setting to be able to customize the sign change color when creating signs.
- Added new error message for when signs are in the wrong format.
- Not a beta version since 1.33 didn't get many bug reports and I've fixed a lot of stuff so this should be pretty stable.
- Some internal stuff for new FC_Suite_Shared update.
- Disabled books being enchantable. Fixes bug and removes another way to get vanilla enchants.
- Fixed issue where class was always resetting.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Classes:
- Can now give a group to players whenever they pick a class. Can also move them out of a group as well. See setup.txt for more information.
- Fixed not being able to have more than 5 spells.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Commands:
- Reformated the /gold command a lot.
- Added /gold view [name].

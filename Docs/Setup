IV: FAQs and Bonus Information

I: Introduction:

    Welcome to the setup for FC_Rpg. I will be blunt, complete configuration of this plugin WILL take you a long time if you want to use it optimally. Yes, you can run the plugin and everything should work fine but you will NOT be satisfied by how things are set up. Expect to spend a good bit of time setting up the hundreds of settings that FC_Rpg has. However, if you do decide to set up FC_Rpg to the fullest, you will experience a new level of configuration for a plugin that will allow you almost perfect control of every single setting. It's truly a beautiful feeling. The goal of this help document is to provide insight into configuring FC_RPG primarily. Thus, every section refers to explaining how to understand and configure the several configuration files.
    
a: Command Usage:

    To begin using FC_Rpg you need to immediately familiarize yourself with the help command, /rpg. /rpg is the most important command as it shows the help for all commands. I intentionally tried to name commands such that they do not override some other major plugins. For example, warp is /w, rather than /warp to prevent conflicts with Essentials warp command. Conversely, the /world command for FC_Rpg conflicts with the /world command for Essentials. So immediately it is in your best interest to disable the world command Essentials by following their instructions. If disabling a command for Essentials is too difficult for you, then, once again I can only stress the amount of difficulty you will probably soon be experiencing!
    
    All of the permissions for the plugin are inside of the doc folder inside of FC_Rpg.jar Just unzip FC_Rpg to gain access to the docs folder. Most permissions are related to commands but there are a few non-command related permissions.
	
	The first command you will need to run is /radmin wall. Find yourself a nice clear area that won't be griefed and type /radmin wall. This command is more like a board... if you fly like 5 blocks into the air and type it you will be more than fine. I would just try not to use it DIRECTLY next to something as it creates an unremovable board. You will need to select your class off of the new board that you generated. Class selection is done through signs.
	
	The next command you will likely need to use is /world levelone. Go find a spot where you want level 1 monsters to spawn and type in /world levelone.
	
	These are the basic commands to get you started. There are several more so feel free to explore them. :)
    
b: Configuration General

    This section is to teach you how to handle the overarching format of all my configuration files, so that you can understand my unique data storage techniques, as well as understand my mindset a bit on how everything is stored. I would like to emphasize that if you do not understand something that you please post a comment on the plugin page. If you post about something mentioned on the help pages, I will tell you simply to read the help. Thank you!
    
    Do NOT change version numbers when you are editing your configuration unless this is requested in a change log update or in response to help. If you lower the number, then that particular configuration file will update from that version number to the most recent version supported by your currently installed version on FC_Rpg. If you raise the version number, then you risk the configuration file not updating during future updates.
    I attempt to store lists of items in compressed forms. The reason why is because I can achieve upwards of 80% line compression and make files go from 500 lines to only 100. Locations are in the format of "world name", x, y, z, yaw, pitch. Yaw = Facing direction in degrees of 360. Pitch is equal to up-down looking direction. I use Bukkit's yaw, this means that if you put 0 in, it will be aligned with what Bukkit does. The reason I say this is because some other plugins will display differently than Bukkit. Please note that I don't use spaces after commas in any of my storage mechanisms. You can assume that anything that is not a location is a list of numbers, or a list of words, etc. etc. Feel free to add as many as you would like to them.
    When you see settings that start at one and count up to five, please do NOT decide to use a number like fifty rather than two when editing the configuration. Try to keep numbers counting in order or things may break. The current tolerance is about fifty numbers for most config checking before a value won't be found, meaning that if FC_Rpg finds fifty empty entries before trying to find an entry it's looking for, it will assume the entry doesn't exist.
    I will have numbers of all sorts that you will have to enter into your configuration file. This can get really confusing at times. Please read descriptions carefully, I will try to make sure that the default number gives you a general idea of what kind of number you might have to enter and as needed I will put down specifics inputs needed.
    This requires a bit of "common sense" but I commonly use a technique of requiring information filled in for only one thing, but under several fields. For example, you will see in the general config file the setting "timedItems" has four parts. Each one of those lines has two items by default and the information each of those items is spread over three lines. Make sure to fill empty fields in with 0 and that each field for the item has the same number of entries.
    
    Disclaimer: This tutorial assumes that the reader is a YAML expert. If you don't know how YAML works please go read some tutorials!

II: Getting Started

    Alright, it's time to begin configuring the plugin for YOUR needs and how YOU want it. Make sure that you followed the FC general plugin installation general procedure and that you have FC_Suite_Shared installed with FC_Rpg installed. Also make sure that you have no errors on the first run of the two plugins and that configuration files have generated for you in your ~/plugins/FC_Rpg/ directory. If everything went off without a hitch, then you're setup and ready to start configuring. If you received errors and such, you probably need to post a ticket. :)
    
    So now you want to first setup your Groups.yml and General.yml The groups.yml should AUTO-PROPOGATE with values from your default permissions provider. If it didn't, because something with FC_Rpg malfunctioned, then you will have to add your groups by hand. If you simply have no groups with your permissions provider, then you will need to add a single group. Basically you need one default group specified minimum in the groups.yml The next section is a breakdown of how to setup groups.yml
    
a: Configuring Groups.yml

    Groups are a mirror image of the groups in your permissions file. FC_Rpg is NOT a permissions provider and will never conflict with GM, PEX, or anything of that nature. By default when this file is generated, all of the groups recognized by FC_Rpg from your permissions provider will be mirrored in. As well, the groups will be given a random color for the lulz for the display name as well as a jobReq of -1 and timeReq of -1.

An Example YAML groups.yml

Groups:
  version: 0.23
  GroupString:
    '0': Guest,&f[§4Guest&f] ,-1,-1

"Guest" is the actual group name straight from your permission provider.
"&f[&7Guest&f] " is the display for the group when using my custom chat override and in /list.
"0" is the time requirement to be automatically promoted into this group (in milliseconds).
"1" is the job requirement to be automatically promoted into this group.

    Order shouldn't matter with optimal setup, but I recommend that you place the least obtainable ranks first followed by the most obtainable ranks last. If you want somebody to never be moved out of a group, set the jobReq and the timeReq for it to -1 each. This will prevent them from ever being kicked out of the group.

b: Configuring General.yml
    
    Now that you have groups.yml setup, you will want to go into General.yml and set "defaultPrefix: " to whatever your default group is for all players. Congratulations! This is your face major milestone! Now that you have set up the basic permissions it's time to start configuring the main settings for FC_Rpg. Once again go into general.yml and prepare to configure all of the settings.

- defaultPrefix - Set this to the default prefix that all players have if they aren't associated with a group. This is really more of a double check for if group checks fail to make things not look very buggy It's very important.
- perfectBirch - With this enabled birch trees will always spawn 5 high with no leaves. This setting is useful for prison servers that want very easy birch tree farms.
- creativeControl - Disables the use of a few grief oriented items in the creative world to prevent people from destroying it or making it really annoying for others. The list of items and effects may be customizable at some point but right now it's just redstone based materials, water, lava, experience potions, eggs, and a few other things.
- hardcoreItemLoss - Hardcore item loss causes players to lose one item when they are hungry and die. The exact numbers are, one (0) item upon death with six (6) or less food and a second item upon death with one or less food.
- expCancelled - Prevent experience from being acquired or gained in RPG worlds. Ensures minecraft level and minecraft experience stays at 0. This does NOT apply to FC_Rpg combat experience, only experience that comes from experience orbs and the like.
- perfectWheat - Makes wheat unable to be harvested until fully grown and will cause wheat to automatically replant.
- infiniteGold - Determines whether or not gold tools should never break. Useful for making 'useless gold' useful!
- infiniteDiamond - Determines whether or not diamond tools should never break. This setting is useful for making your server very easy mode. :)
- betterFishing - Currently only gives fishing rods infinite durability.
- preventSpongBreak - Set whether players can break sponges or not.  (I have another plugin called FC_Sponge, won’t go into it here though, lol)
- donatorBonusStatPercent - Set a bonus percent that donators get to stats.

    Since this is the first time that this comes up, I will state right here. Basically whenever you see "percent" that means you have to convert the percent into a decimal. Old school math, 100% = 1. 50% = .5. Basically x% * .01 = % as decimal. So if you want donators to have 20% bonus stats, then set this to 0.2. "Multipliers" will generally mean the same thing but you won't start seeing me use that term really until we start working with Balance.yml The only time you should expect to put in numbers for percents is when dealing with probabilities for numbers. I'll try to be really clear on this throughout all the documentation what is expected as input.

- donatorLootBonusPercent - Set the bonus amount of money and experience that donators get when killing mobs.
- levelCap - Set the levelcap for your server. Setting this above 100 will require extra customization on your part as the default settings are intended ONLY for up to level 100.
- jobRankCosts - Set the costs for the /job promote command that players can use.

    This is one of my "compressed" lists. Normally Bukkit puts lists on several lines, but I personally feel that took up too much space so I made it so lists are on one line. Put all entries one by one separated by a comma for compressed lists.

- notificationInterval - This determines exactly how often a player will receive an attack, heal, dodge, thorns, etc. notification. This is in milliseconds. Almost all time inputs are either milliseconds or seconds. If you see a lot of zeroes after a default entry, the time is probably in milliseconds.
- scale - The scale entry is for determining how fast mobs level up the further they move away from the "levelone" setting for a world; we'll see more on that in the world.yml section. - x - This number determines how many blocks you must go in an x direction before mobs increase a level. - z- Same as x but in z direction. - y - This number decides how fast monsters will level as you go further down the y scale. Increasing this number will make mobs level slower, decreasing will make monsters level faster.
- timedItems - These are items given to all players for every time interval. It's basically free gifts for players! - ids - The id for the item you want to give to players. Disable timed items by setting to 0. - counts - The amount to give of the item that correlates to the block id. - datavalues - The data value for the items. - interval - How often to give out the items.
- disableEnderPearls - Disable enderpearls if you want.
- dungeonSelectionToolID - This is the a tool that can be used to select points to help view information for dungeon setup with /dungeon print, (more information later).
- donatorsCanHat - When set to true, people that are set to donator through the /modify command are able to always use /hat even without the command permission.
- chatFormat - This lets you specify the chat format for everybody without the FC_Rpg admin permission node. The keywords are in-between percent signs '%'. You can rearrange these however you wish and put in whatever colors you want.
- chatFormatAdmin - This lets you specify the chat format for everybody with the FC_Rpg admin permission node.
- inactivePlayerFileDeleteTime - Specify how long a player has to be inactive before their player file is deleted. Set to 0 if you don't want player files to ever be deleted.
- buffCommandCost - This is the cost to use the /buff random command.
- bonusMobSpawns - Enabling this setting will spawn additional mobs around players in rpg worlds. The mobs will only spawn at night or whenever there is a storm "default minecraft rules". They also don't spawn in liquids.
- commandKeyWord - Changing these settings allow you to change any command inside of FC_Rpg. Simply change it's command name in plugin.yml for the command rename to take effect.
- recordExpRewards - Trade in records for experience! Gold = 100% (garunteed levelup), Green = 50%, Record_4 = 1%, 5 = 5%, 6 = 10%, 7 = 15%, 8 = 20%, 9 = 25%.
- customChatExclusion - Allows you to disable custom rpg chat when specified phrases appear in the chat format of player messages. Don't change if you don't understand chat formats. Disables custom chat for towny private chat channels by default.

c: Configuring World.yml

    The worlds section allows you to manage worlds for the FC_Rpg plugin. The main structure is Worlds followed by the world name, followed by settings for the world.

- worldType - Sets what type of world the world is. 0 = Vanilla / 1 = Creative.
- isRpg - Sets whether FC_RPG should actively work in this world or not.
- isPvp - Sets whether this world contains the pvp arena or not. If your pvp settings are configured, will be described later, then you required at least one world with this setting enabled.
- isSpawn - Sets whether this world is the primary spawn point for new players or not. You need to have at least one spawn world.
- isMobWorld - Will prevent the spawn of all monsters that aren't from dungeons.
- isAoEWorld - Set whether people should AoE break everything in a 3x3x3 radius when using pickaxes of a tier higher than wooden.
- spawn - The spawn location for the world.
- levelOne: This is the point where mobs will spawn at level one. Mobs will become stronger as they move away from this location.

Please note that there are commands in-game in the /radmin section section that will help you greatly in setting the spawn and levelOne settings.

III: Intermediate Steps

    Alright so you have now configured two configs but there are eleven more! Some configs can be entirely ignored if you don't want to use the features that are provided by it. For example, if you don't want FC_Rpg world management, then you are welcome to simply ignore the worlds config entirely. If you don't want to use the warps, ignore the warps config. Same goes for faqs, dungeons, etc. etc. You, the server owner, have to determine what you want enabled for your server and so this section will provide the information for how to set up configs. So enjoy the freethinking that you are allowed to do here and once everything is configured, you're good to go! Good luck!

b. Configuring Faqs.yml

    The Faqs section allows you to setup useful information for your server that any player can view by typing /faq. This is a very useful feature as it allows servers to setup their help pages easily in the form of easily selectable topics! Simply follow the format of the default faq to help you in setting up a faq. It might also be helpful to use the /faq command on the server to get a feel for how it works.

- name - The topic that will be displayed as the header for the faq
- tag - The keyword to access and view a particular faq topic.<br />
- faq1 - Faqs can be split into two parts so that you can use two colors. Put the first half of a faq here.
- faq2 - This is the second part of a faq. If you only want to use one part, the first color, then put in '[empty]' in the matching location for faq1. It is important that your faq1 and faq2 be ordered together if you want faqs to be displayed properly.

c. Configuring Spells.yml

    The spell configuration allows you to create spells to have specific settings as to how you want. Due to the nature of there being so many effect ids, and that they are all utilized in the default generation of the spells config, please refer to a default spells config file to see what each effect id does. That means you should probably make a backup of the default for reference :D. Please note that spells are setup so that you can have fields missing (like attack magnitude doesn't need to be included if you don't want that to be applied to your spell) and it won't mess things up.

- effectID: Determines exactly what the spell does. Decides if a spell will be dodge, taunt, a fireball, strikes lightning etc.
- name: The name of the spell
- description: A short description of the spell.
- duration: How long you want the spell to last at each rank.
- manaCost: How much mana the spell should cost per rank.
- restricted: Does the spell require a target at the minimum as well as possibly an item restriction defined by the class?
- constantMagnitude: This setting varies with every spell. This basically is the "base" strength that any spell will have. It's hard to describe, but when you play around with it and see how spells work a bit, I think it will make sense.
- attackMagnitude: Allows you to alter the magnitude of a spell with attack.
- constitutionMagnitude: Allows you to alter the magnitude of a spell with constitution.
- magicMagnitude: Allows you to alter the magnitude of a spell with magic.
- intelligenceMagnitude: Allows you to alter the magnitude of a spell with intelligence.

	The formula for spell magnitude is roughly: constantMagnitude + (attackMagnitude * playerAttack) + (constitutionMagnitude * playerConstitution) + (same for magic) + (same for intelligence) = finalSpellMagnitude. The final spell magnitude will be the final strength of a spell. Spell magnitude is used to determine spell strength based on the effectID. So for the dodge buff, having higher spell magnitude means a higher chance to dodge. For fireballs, it equates to a higher base damage for fireballs. It is important to note that the spells lightning, fireball, and remedy draw their power mostly from stats (set to magic magnitude by default) and if you want to make a fireballs stronger by tier and reduce the influence of magic on the spell, you will probably have to increase the constant magnitude by high numbers whereas most other spells require very small changes.

Happy Casting!

d. Configuring Classes.yml

	The class configuration allows you to define a class with the features that you desire. Classes can currently only have up to five spells (will be modified soon in an upcoming version).

- name: The name of the class.
- description: A short description of the class.
- spellIDs: Put down the spells that you want to have for this class here. The spells must be drawn from your Spells.yml
- passiveID: Give the class some unique feature. Passive IDs are explained below. Classes can only have one.
- restrictionID: This makes it so that the player has to have a specific item to cast restricted spells. Restirction IDs are listed below. Classes can only have one.
- statGrowth: Put down attack, constitution, magic, intelligence stat growths for this class each level.

passiveIDs - Can be customized in balance config.
- 1 - ScalingArrows - Higher level = faster arrows.
- 2 - CounterAttack - 10% chance to counterattack.
- 3 - StrongerParry - 25% parry damage reduction vs. the normal 10%
- 4 - InnerFire - 4% mana regeneration a second vs. normal 1%.
- 5 - BattleLust - Damage increases propertionally to missing health.

restrictionIDs
- 1 = Requires a bow to cast restricted spells.
- 2 = Requires a stick to cast restricted spells.

e. Configuring Dungeon.yml

	Dungeons are probably the most interesting and complicated feature to setup. I can honestly only advise that you read this section extremely carefully and possibly multiple times. I will have a video specifically for dungeons only tomorrow added. I can't make one now as it's 3 am.

First:

	Dungeons require you to create a lobby as well as a physical dungeon before going forward. Please make sure you construct those.

	Some tips regarding dungeon creation are that Dungeons may be disjointed in design. You can have rooms that players teleport to, or even have walkways where mobs can't spawn, really any kind of design is acceptable. However, it would be VERY wise to create a dungeon where you can define spawn regions, basically rectangles for mob spawning, easily. One way to garuntee you will have a very easy to setup dungeon, is start with a cube. If you don't have World Edit or VoxelSniper, well, that's going to be a lot of block placing ^^. Then hollow out the inside of the cube and put your dungeon there. The reason I recommend starting with a cube is just because it gives thick walls with very little room for mobs to spawn outside as the dungeon as well as two very easy to select dungeon points. If you want to have multiple dungeon sections, start each section inside a cube. Do you have to do this? No. But I feel, personally, that this is the easiest and fastest way to get started making dungeons.
	
	One major thing to keep in mind is to MAKE SURE, that your selection points are NOT TOUCHING ANY WALLS. You need to be selecting points in the air that aren't touching walls in order for mobs to spawn. I will have a video showing this off and saying it in the video but try to select air or your dungeon may or may not work.
	
	Some things to keep in mind is that if you don't build thick walls and your dungeon spawn regions extend past walls, you can have mobs that spawn outside of your dungeons.
	
	Also, remember that if you put objects inside of your dungeon and your spawn regions for mobs include those objects, mobs can spawn on top of them. An example object is a tree. If you put a spawn region somewhere that contains lots of trees, you can have mobs that spawn on top of trees. This is just a headsup.
	
Second:

	You need entry and exit signs. The template for them is "Teleport:" on the first line followed by the "Dungeon " plus the dungeon number on the second line. As you might imagine, this is similar to warp signs, but instead of the teleport name on the second line you are specifying the dungeon number.
	
	To create a dungeon exit sign, put down "Teleport:" on the first line followed by "-Dungeon x-" on the second line; the x is represents the dungeon number. It is highly recommended you put a dungeon exit sign in the lobby for the dungeon AND inside of the actual dungeon.
	
Third:

	You will have to setup your configuration file to map out your dungeon so that everything will be instanced out! Follow the template provided as closely as you can. To make this easy, I will simply use one of the default dungeons and mark in italics what the section does.

Example Dungeon.yml

Dungeons:
  version: 1.0 <- Don't change versions
  '0': <- This is the dungeon number.
    name: Grasslands <- Assign a name to the dungeon
    entryFee: 50.0 <- Assign an entry fee. Set to 0 if you don't want an entry fee. (In next version, if set to 0, the message won't appear that you paid, sorry about that)
    timer:
      join: 60 <- I actually forgot to implement this... woops, will be in next version, sorry, LOL. Basically how long before a dungeon starts.
      end: 600 <- Forgot to implement this also, how long before a dungeon ends.
    playerLevelRequirement:
      minimum: 0 <- Lowest FC_Player level that can enter a dungeon.
      maximum: 100 <- Highest FC_Player level that can enter a dungeon.
    mobsToSpawnCount: 50 <- Number of mobs to spawn
    lobby: island,135.5,83,15.5,92,0 <- The lobby that players teleported into when they hit the teleport sign.
    start: island,144.5,87,15.5,270,0 <- The place that players teleport to after the join timer expires; generally just put at the start of your dungeon.
    exit: island,128.5,83,15.5,270,0 <- The spot players are teleported to after a dungeon is cleared.
    bossSpawn: island,341.5,87,16.5,270,0 <- The spot that the boss monster spawns.
    treasure:
      start: <- These are treasure chests that are generated whenever a dungeon begins.
        '0': island,185,87,6,0,0
      end: <- These are treasure chests that are generated whenever a dungeon is cleared.
        '0': island,344,87,15,0,0
    spawnBox: <- Spawnboxes are basically defined regions where monsters will spawn when a dungeon starts. You need two selections to define the rectangle (or cube), then you need a chance for mobs to spawn in that particular spawnbox and lastly you list the mobs that will spawn in that spawnbox. You can spawn cows, blazes (if you're evil), heck, probably even the wither! Mobs will only ever spawn inside of the region you define here if you start up a dungeon. Dungeons override all monster spawning so you will get no mob spawning whatsoever in the regions you define below.
      selection1:
        '0': island,141,86,3,0,0
      selection2:
        '0': island,344,96,29,0,0
      spawnChance:
        '0': 100
      mobList:
        '0': ZOMBIE,PIGZOMBIE,SKELETON,SPIDER <- See -> http://jd.bukkit.org/apidocs/index.html, find EntityType on the lefthand side and you will see a list of acceptable entities to spawn. Don't add spaces.

	Simply count up to add more spawn ranges and make sure you add in some solid numbers. 100 spawn chance = 100% chance to spawn there. Spawn chance numbers don't need to add up to 100 so you can do 33, 33, 33 for 3 platforms if you would like.

f. Configuring Treasure.yml

	The treasure config handles loot from dungeon chests as well as mob drops. In a future version all item drops will be configurable. Please note that all of the chance variables should be read as X.XX%. This means, like 100.00% = 10000. All of the chance percents are out of 100. If you want a 35.3% chance of an item dropping, you MUST enter 3530. The key is adding the zero at the end. Zero's to the right are important but those on the far left aren't.

-  dropChances: This is a list of chances that an item will drop. The first number is the chance for one drop, the second for a second drop, third for a third drop, etc. Rolls are done one after another, so if you pass the first roll, then the second roll will be called. So if you get one item, then you will experience another roll from 1-100 for a second item, then another roll from 1-100, etc. etc.
-  enchantChances - This is the chance that an item will receive an enchantment. Each additional number is the chance for another enchant after receiving an enchant.
-  enchantLevelFiveChance - This determines the chance for rolling a stronger enchantment for enchants that have five maximum levels. The roll for the strength of an enchantment is done all at once. For example, by using the default, there is always a 100% chance of getting a level enchantment when you roll an enchant. The 5000 = 50% chance for a level 2 enchant. The 8000 = 30% chance for a level 3 enchant (8000 - 5000 = 3000 which = 30.00%). The 9500 = 15% chance for a level 4 enchant. The 9900 = 4% chance for a level 5 enchant.
-  enchantLevelFourChance -  This determines the chance for rolling a stronger enchantment for enchants that have four maximum levels.
-  enchantLevelThreeChance - I think you can figure this out :D.
-  enchantLevelTwoChance - :D

g. Configuring Warps.yml

The Warp section allows you to list out warps you want on your server. The following is the format for a warp sign: http://dev.bukkit.org/thumbman/images/47/305/600x434/2012-09-23_01.33.22.png.-m1.png. Note that the brackets around the warp name are optional.

By default your configuration file will create warps to all of your worlds. This means you can access world spawns with the /radmin tpworld [world] command and through signs. Worlds are listed numerically from 0 to 1000. Simply add a new world by following the previous structure of world nodes and then change the settings to what you would like.

- name - Set the name of the warp
- description - Give the warp a description. There is no limit to how many lines you add to the description. Don't add the [&id + some numbers] part to additional descriptions.
- welcome - Add a welcome message for using the warp.
- exit - Add an exit message for using the warp.
- cost - Add a cost. 0.0 = free.
- admin - Specify if only admins can use the warp or not.
- donator - Specify if only donators can use the warp or not.
- destination - Specify the location the warp will take you too.

f. Configuring Pvp.yml

The pvp section lets you run a VERY minimalist pvp arena. If you want an extreme pvp arena, get something else. This is just a very basic one. I am going to expand on the features of this a little bit in the future. Right now exits are the pvp worlds spawn by default.

-  pvpArenaReward: -1.0 <- When set to -1 this means the arena is disabled. Increasing to 0 will enable pvp arenas. Increasing beyond that will give a reward to players that win in the arena.
-  spawn1: island,180.0,81.0,106.0,180.0,0.0 <- Spawn point for team 1.
-  spawn2: island,177.0,81.0,72.0,270.0,0.0 <- Spawn point for team 2.
-  lobby1: island,170.0,99.0,82.0,270.0,0.0 <- Lobby for team 1.
-  lobby2: island,185.0,99.0,97.0,90.0,0.0 <- Lobby for team 2.

I know there are teams, but it's actually free for all... I'll make the spawn points a list in the future. The pvp arena is the most underdeveloped feature currently in my opinion. It was never a big focus of the plugin but I wanted something simple for my server without a massive plugin.

g. Configuring Balance.yml

Welp, it was asked that players could configure the balance of the plugin, so here you go! Plugin balance. Customize the effectiveness of a leather chestplate, or a diamondsword, make regen stronger. Anything is entirely customizable with the balance config.

Formulas:

- Experience Formula -> Code = (int) (getClassLevel() * getClassLevel() * FC_Rpg.balanceConfig.getPlayerExpScaleRate() + FC_Rpg.balanceConfig.getPlayerExpScaleBase()); - Translation -> playerLevel * playerLevel * expScaleRate + expScaleBase

- Mob Level Formula -> Code = (1 + modifier / FC_Rpg.balanceConfig.getDifficultyScalor()) - Translation -> 1 + monsterlevel / difficultyScalor

- Mob Attack Formula -> Code = FC_Rpg.balanceConfig.getMobAttackMultiplier() * modifier * difficultyCoefficient; - Translation = Result of mob level formula, times level, times mob attack multiplier.

Configuration settings:

- difficultyScalor: 500 <- Involved in mob level formula that determines the rate that monsters level up. Setting closer to 0 equals stronger mobs. Increasing this will make mobs level up more slowly.
- randomMobLevelDeviation: 2 <- How many levels up and down can monsters be roughly from level one. If you set to 5, then level 10 monsters can be level 5 through 15.
- powerLevelPrevention: 5 <- Players fighting monsters of level (playerLevel + or - powerLevelPrevention) will not recieve any combat loot.
- globalExpMultiplier: 1 <- Change the amount of MINECRAFT experience given from everything. This does NOT apply to FC_RPG experience.
- witherLevelBonus: 100 <- Give the wither a level bonus for all spawns.
- enderDragonLevelBonus: 50 <- Give the enderdragon a level bonus for all spawns.
- defaultItemDrops: true <- Enable default minecraft drops or disable them, like rotten_flesh, slimeballs, etc.
- arrowKnockback: false <- Enable or disable arrow knockback.
- bonusPercentCap: 3.0 <- Maximum amount of bonus experience that players can recieve from fighting monsters stronger them theirselves. This is useful for capping experience from fighting bosses.
- enchantmentMultiplier: <- These are multipliers for one (1) individual level of an enchantment. So sharpness four will by default be a multiplier of 0.08. So total damage dealt would be equal to 1 * 1.08 (my formulas add the 1 automatically), which is 8% more damage.
	sharpness: 0.02
	bane: 0.02
	smite: 0.02
	power: 0.02
	protection: 0.025
	fire: 0.025

	attack: 1 <- Determine how much damage a point of attack gives.
	constitution: 20 <- Determine how much health a point of constitution gives.
	intelligence: 1 <- Determine how much mana a point of intelligence gives.
- levelsPerSkillPoint: 4 <- Determine how many levelups a player has to undergo before recieving a skill point.
- statsPerLevel: 10 <- Determine how many stat points a player recieves per levelup.
- expScaleRate: 3 <- Used in experience formula.
- expScaleBase: 11 <- Used in experience formula.
- mob:
	attackMultiplier: 2 <- Set the rate that mob attack scales in mob attack formula.
	constitutionMultiplier: 100 <- Set the rate that mob constution scales in mob constitution formula. The mob constitution formula is the same as the attackMultiplier except for the two facts that it revolves around constitution and non-hostile mobs have a constitution of 1 by defualt.
	lootPercent:
		stronger: 0.2 <- Each level above the player that kills a mob, they get this percent more experience and money. So this is 20% by default more experience and gold per monster level above the default players level.
		weaker: 0.166667 <- The opposite of lootPercent.stronger. Weaker mobs will give 16.6% less experience/gold epr level.
		spawnWithItemChance: 20 <- Chance mobs will spawn with items.
	spawnWithEnchantsChance: 40 <- Chance mob items will be enchanted.
	cashMultiplier: 0.8 <- Final cash amount given by monsters will be multiplied by this.
	expMultiplier: 1.0 <- Final experience amount given by monsters will be multiplied by this.
- sword:
	multiplier: <- Change the strength of swords based on the type.
		wood: 1.25 <- Note that you HAVE to add the 1 or you will start dealing with losing damage for decimals.

			helmet: 0.01
			leggings: 0.015
			chestplate: 0.02
		chain:
			boots: 0.01

	strength: 0.05 <- 5% more damage per point of strength a potion has.
	weakness: 0.05 <- 5% less damage per point.
	resistance: 0.05 <- 5% more damage reduction.
- healMultiplier: <- Change the effectiveness of regeneration effects on the player.
	eating: 0.05 <- I'm guessing this is like golden apple or something, no idea really but 5% is pretty balance for everything so it's at 5%.
	magic: 0.2 <- Heal potions and magical effects.
	magicRegen: 0.05 <- Regeneration strength. (Regen is baws)
	satiated: 0.02 <- How much you heal with full hunger.

h. Configuring Guilds.yml

No need to configure anything in this file currently. It's best if you don't ever alter this file currently.

IV: FAQs and Bonus Information

I have created this section to give a little bit of advice about random tidbits that will hopefully HELP you use my plugin even futher. These are

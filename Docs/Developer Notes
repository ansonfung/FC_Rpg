Data Upgrade Plan:

A new way to handle data retrieval, schema.

* Data Storage.

Data can be either static or dynamic.

- Static Data.

Data we expect to be static, we will load into hashmaps. All fields for a program will be added to List<String> fieldList = new ArrayList<Field>();

HashMap examples: Map<String, Object> staticObjectMap = new HashMapMap<String, Object>();
HashMap examples: Map<String, Object> staticLocationMap = new HashMapMap<String, Object>();

- Dynamic Data

Data that will be dynamic, we will load directly into memory. Any time changes are made to the data, the information will be changed in memory. Every interval of time, the data will be auto-saved back into the files.

For MySQL, we can still perform the same logic.

* Data Retreival

We want to always make sure that the variable exists first. For static data, if the value doesn't exist, then we will create a default for it. For dynamic data, if there are no entries, we want to return null.

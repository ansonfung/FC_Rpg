~ FC_Rpg, Developer Personal Notes ~

^Todo List^

- I tried my best. But it seems that I will have to make enchants from items and armor load up each time you are hit. Use unique string to prevent items from needing to be updated constantly.

- Update sign format for dungeons. "Teleport: " "name of dungeon"

- Doublecheck that lifesteal and mana vamp are properly notifying of drained and mana. - done with hp.
- Make tiers work. - done.
- Fix fucking durability on swords.

- Add into help that items stored in enderchests lose lore when stored and server restarts.

- I have made it so that spells that normally are one-time cast can last for durations. 
- Now, I need to make it so that spells that are normally a duration will apply once then be removed. After that, all spells should be done. :)

- Test that enchanted items don't count as lore "the enchants aren't lore" and people can't rename items as a cheat way of getting super items. Maybe think of better method like checking for the dashed lines in lore. That might be better.
- Test frost strikes not breaking.

- Replace berserker spell with something other than teleport. Need ideas on this :/ *sigh*. "test"
- Add in commands to handle some of the new features after they have been tested as completely bug free. "test"
- Customizable mob stats.

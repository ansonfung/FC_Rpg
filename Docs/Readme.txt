Description:
FC_Rpg is a plugin that completely converts bukkit servers into RPG servers. FC_Rpg aims to be the number one RPG plugin that can be easily installed to any world of a server, or all if you prefer, and setup quickly by not requiring spout or client mods. By using FC_Rpg, you can bring an RPG experience to your server like no other! Do not let this short description fool you, FC_Rpg is backed by nearly a year of development time with easily 1,000+ work hours invested. FC_Rpg is jam packed with more features than you might believe. With 125+ commands, unique features you can find nowhere else like instanced dungeons, old-school stats, custom enchanted items, and spells, FC_Rpg is the clear plugin of choice to bring the medieval age to your server.

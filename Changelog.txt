Version 0.2:

- A lot of the focus on this version is to get things into a more permanent state. I realized that there are quite a few broken pieces of code from back when I was running FC_RPG on my server. The main goal of this release is to fix a lot of those and some of the things I was doing in the 0.1 version. So, as such, a lot of stuff broke, as you could imagine. I could write up an upgrade guide but the amount of work people would have to do is highly unreasonable. And as such, I sadly have to say that you have to wipe out everything from before. I would keep a backup though, as a lot of settings are the same when you have to redo them. The main thing is that on my FC_Announcer, FC_Bans, and FC_Bounties plugin, I recently had to do a lot of configuration options post-release which I am actually kind of ashamed of. I don't think it's acceptable and so I focused very hard on making it so that all the configuration files are seperate now and all past improperly named code/config settings are more appropriate now. Here's to hoping I never have to ask for file wips in the future *toasts air*.
- The donator stat percent now updates properly for /class view.
- Renamed "Overlord" section of config to "General" section now.\
- All configuration files are now seperated into what they each respectively handle.
- Redid spells and classes entirely so that they are totally customizable. This was a "MASSIVE" project and took easily 100+ hours to do alone. I hope you guys enjoy the work! ^^. A lot of changes to magic, spells, and classes are pretty much why the delete everything is absolutely necessary.
- h now has premissions on it to prevent everybody from using.
- Monster levels now scale away from spawn based on world spawns rather than the previous 0,0,0 coords. This allows you to define where you want level 1 monsters to spawn at now.
- Reordered player file to be a subclass of the configgod class which allowed me to better order the code and make it more readable at the cost of optimization (Extremely unnoticable deoptimization though).

Version 0.1

- First release of the plugin. Woot.

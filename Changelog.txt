Version 0.5:

- Please note that this build is again, a really fast rushed build, I'm working as fast as possible to push these builds out! Reporting issues is fantastic for me! Thanks :D
- Heal command and gm commands will no longer say success while at the same time saying successfully healed/gamemoded a player.
- Added a new general config setting that allows you to prevent ender pearl teleportation. Allows me to delete my seperate project FC_NoEnderPearls, xD :D!
- Had a lot of doubles relating to exp scaling set to return ints when they should be doubles! REALLY GLAD I CAUGHT THIS, LOL. Fixed now.
- Artificial damage cause added to players in damagelistener. As well, eventpriority set to high. This means other plugins should be able to cancel/override FC_RPG is at lower ep's and can hook in at higher EP's. (Allows FC_Bounties compatibility for example).
- Fixed double loot event never ending.
- Fixed mob spawning levels going negative direction and negative levels. Should work fine always now.
- Fixed treasure config issue with getting drop chance never resetting number of items dropped. Also updated default item drop chances. Finally fixed checking mob level for item drops.
- Fixed improperly reading exp/gold value multipliers from config for mob money. Also updated the anti-powerleveling to prevent giving exp/gold.
- Did a good bit of updating to commands again to make even more commands usable via console. Also fixed some bugs/errors with them.
- Organized and Optimized the /dungeon command.
- Dungeon command now has several dungeon sub-commands.
- Heavily improved the /dungeon command. Now you can create dungeons in-game by selecting points to define regions for them.
- Going to be working on this hard for 0.6 to let you change more settings in-game.

- Organized and Optimized the rpg command.
- Moved /rpg modify to be just /modify now.
- Console can use both now. Maybe bugs with console getting errors still, I'm always working on these but if you find one feel free to make a ticket.

- Organized and Optimized the reset command.
- Console can use to reset other players now.


(INCOMPLETE, 1.4 DEV BUILD INTERUPT, will be in 0.6)
- Organized and Optimized the dungeon command.
- (TODO - TEST) - Added /warp command.
- I changed the implementation for pvp arena around a lot. It's untested entirely so yeah it could be really really buggy. Just a warning. I need to test it.

Version 0.4:

- This version is NOT compatible with other FC plugins currently (unless you recently recieved a custom version from me). Just a heads up.
- Wolves are now considered passive mobs because I can't figure out how to make them aggressive, :S
- Configurable item restrictions.
- Fixed Stat Growth for all classes being broken.
- New config "Passives" to update passives. Might change into something else more expansive.
- Mob Money is 100% configurable.
- Exp Growth is 100% configurable
- Dungeon treasure is now 100% configurable
- Alchemy will NOT be made configurable. But I do take suggestions on the skill! I want this to be a skill that brings in a diverse range of items to all servers, I don't want people to be able to limit this range so if you don't like the skill don't use it! XD :D
- Fixed a loot issue that may or may not been an issue.
- Made dungeons that work without rpg mode enabled.
- All locations now require a yaw and pitch, even if you have to put 0.0 in each spot. The default warp generation didn't put the 2 0's for yaw/patch and as such you will have to manually fill them in if you want default warps to work.
- Fixed list to never mess up. Can only show player names once now which makes it work perfectly :)
- Mob strength properly adjusts to world's spawn.
- promote alias for "upgrade" for skill points.
- Updated the /rpg wall to now add warps as well as new updated finish signs. It's not as obvious that I coded the manual respec into selection and the gold color can be hard to see on certain texture packs. As well it puts all the warp signs down for easy copy+paste.
- Put /reset requirement display notifcation on actual class selection.
- Added small message when you select a class that tells you to actually hit a finish sign.
- ResetLoc has been entirely disabled. The teleport it gives has been removed. I can do this now because players who don't have an rpg class should be restricted from doing a lot of things now so there isn't as much of a "forced" requirement to actually have an rpg class. Will be monitered and updated as needed if bugs arise.
- 0.4 was mostly a bug fix and customization version imo. It adds a few things but a lot of changes were to fix bugs. As always I aim to achieve as few bugs as possible. 0.5 will bring even more customization to the table. Everything is getting closer and closer now to being extremely configurable. I think that the last version will require a complete reset, because there are lots of fragments of code getting spewn about. However, everything is getting really close to release ready. I just need to basically expand on the existing features already to make them more accessible outside of editing configs via more commands. 0.4's documentation will be done tonight.

Version 0.31:

- Fixed /list command.

Version 0.3:

- Please understand, all of the changes in this are from the last two days. There are definately many bugs. I'm coding as fast as possible to fix/add features and the cost of this is bugginess. I try to test what I can but not everything is fully tested. This version is EXTREMELY rushed, and I mean EXTREMELY. So please bear with it. I tried to test everything once but I didn't test comprehensively.

- Fixed the resetting of player classes so that they can use sign walls to pick classes again. This was a conflict from the new spell system and optimized player mangement system that I had created (didn't mention in changelog for 0.2).
- Removed everything regarding hunters. It was a remanence from my old server and doesn't serve a purpose.
- Removed a few remnances of jobs from error messages as well from comments/code.

- Organized and optimized all commands. They may be buggy in the next version, I tried to test them all but some bugs may have gotten through. The focus was on making commands more efficient, organized, powerful, and feature-rich. As well, console now has access to select commands. ALL HAIL THE CONSOLE!

- Organized and Optimized the class command.
- Recoded class switching a bit. Now, admins will now always see the ticket dialog. Also, admins have infinite class switch tickets now.
- (Note To Self) Test /class view (on and offline)

- Organized and Optimized the donator command.
- Console can't use donator command.

- Organized and Optimized the dungeon command.
- Organized and Optimized the FaqCE command.

- Organized and Optimized the /g and /h commands. 
- Now you can use /g, /h, /gh, or /hg to get gamemode and/or heal. This allows you to mix them to get both effects at once. I know, I know, put it back in your pants.

- Organized and Optimized the hat command.
- Organized and Optimized the job command.

- Organized and Optimized the list command.
- List now properly works hand in hand with the groups config unlike previously.

- Organized and Optimized the party command.

- Organized and Optimized the rpg command.
- Fixed /rpg modify stat to work properly now.

- Group file now automatically generates. This should help with the confusion that for some reason my plugin is being a permissions provider. IT ISN'T! However, the groups are used for automatic promotions and chat. I will elaborate more on these in documenation. As well, rank freeze was removed. To freeze a rank set the jobReq and timeReq's to -1.
- Can now set the rate at which mob strength scales from world spawns.
- Mob y depth based strength is now capped at 3x as high by default. As well, it is a formula so mob strength will transition very smoothly as you go deeper rather than double, triple, pentouple etc. instantly. (Customizable ofc)
- Can now disable the rpg chat setting.
- Reduced calls to general config substantially which improves performance a lot (well probably not noticibly ^^). Effects startup time and playerjoins.
- Hourly items are now entirely customizable. They are now called "Timed items" and you can set them to anything! Default = 5 steak + 1 GAPPLE:1
- New world setting "LevelOne" which is where level one monsters will spawn.
- Updated the admin help to be smaller and updated based on commands.

Version 0.2:

- A lot of the focus on this version is to get things into a more permanent state. I realized that there are quite a few broken pieces of code from back when I was running FC_RPG on my server as well as misnamed stuff. A big example is that when I started the plugin the stat 'Attack' was referred to as 'Strength'. However, I changed it from strength to attack which meant that like 1/2 the code was saying strength another half was saying attacked. The main goal of this release is to fix a lot of issues like this other things from the 0.1 version. So, as such, a lot of stuff broke, as you could imagine. I could write up an upgrade guide but the amount of work people would have to do is highly unreasonable. And as such, I sadly have to say that you have to wipe out everything from before. I would keep a backup though, as a lot of settings are the same when you have to redo them. The main thing is that on my FC_Announcer, FC_Bans, and FC_Bounties plugin, I recently had to do a lot of configuration options post-release which I am actually kind of ashamed of. I don't think it's acceptable to make such changes post-release and so I focused very hard on making it so that all the configuration files are seperate now and all past improperly named code/config settings are more appropriate now. Here's to hoping I never have to ask for file wips in the future *toasts air*. However, it's still beta, I give no garuntees yet. :P
- The donator stat percent now updates properly for /class view.
- Renamed "Overlord" section of config to "General" section now.
- All configuration files are now seperated into what they each respectively handle.
- Redid spells and classes entirely so that they are totally customizable. This was a "MASSIVE" project and took easily 100+ hours to do alone. I hope you guys enjoy the work! ^^. A lot of changes to magic, spells, and classes are pretty much why the delete everything is absolutely necessary.
- h now has premissions on it to prevent everybody from using.
- Monster levels now scale away from spawn based on world spawns rather than the previous 0,0,0 coords. This allows you to define where you want level 1 monsters to spawn at now.
- Reordered player file to be a subclass of the configgod class which allowed me to better order the code and make it more readable at the cost of optimization (Extremely unnoticable deoptimization though).
- Pvp config will always be generated, moved pvp arena reward to there.
- Knockback works now on swords! Thanks Njol in this thread -> http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/knockback-entity-to-entity.61053/. Simple? Dear god, impossible! LOL
- Began first phase of customizing treasure. Mob and dungeon loot are now fully customizable. Alchemy customization will come with the next "skill customization" file in the next update.
- Remember this is still beta, so there may be bugs, particularly with the spells. If you find any feel free to open up a ticket or leave a comment. I plan to keep working on the next version but I want to get this out so people can report bugs. :)

Version 0.1

- First release of the plugin. Woot.
